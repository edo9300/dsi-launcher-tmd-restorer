# Launcher tmd restorer
A basic homebrew with a single job, put back the right `title.tmd` for the
System Menu (LAUNCHER), it also fixes the permissions of the tmd and the
launcher if they were left unchanged by unlaunch.
This is meant to be used to recover from an unlaunch uninstall brick, but could
also be used as a crude unlaunch uninstaller.

## WARNING
This can modify your internal system NAND! There is *always* a risk of
**bricking**, albeit small, when you modify NAND. Please proceed with caution.
